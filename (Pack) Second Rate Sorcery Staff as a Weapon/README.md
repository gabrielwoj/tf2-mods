# (Pack) Second Rate Sorcery Staff as a Weapon

(To view previews, navigate through the Style folders and check the available screenshots)

A mod that replaces a variety of weapons to the staff seen in the Second Rate Sorcery taunt. It also includes backpack icons for every replacement.

Includes both Non-VPK and VPK.

There's two styles: 

Held Middle;

Held Lower.

Each one differs how the staff is held by the mercenaries.

Reason why it was never published: Forgot to do physics model, after have made all screenshots and organized every folder. Also would improve how it's being held by Engineer and Spy (for no clipping). Mod is functional, but attempting to grab a "fallen" staff on the world may be difficult due to the lack of the physics model.
