# tf2-mods

A repository containing mods I've created for Team Fortress 2.

## Tags

The following tags will be included as prefixes, and indicates the type of the mod. Available tags:

-(Bloodless) - Mods that removes blood from textures;

-(Consistency) - Mods that changes colors of textures in order to achieve consistency. Such as gold/silver, Waterlogged Lab Coat colors, Cream Spirit, and so on;

-(HUD) - Mods that are a modification of the Heads-Up Display;

-(Inconsistency) - Like Consistency, but reversed. Mods that aim to go as inconsistent as possible;

-(Pack) Mods that were packed into a compilation. Mods like these would be ready to be published in sites like Gamebanana. Mods like these usually are separated with several folders, including extras and stuff.

If a mod doesn't include a prefix, it means it's a general mod, and it's not categorized by any of the types above.

A mod may include more than one version. In case of such, there'll be folders for each version included on the mod's directory.
